//! Integration tests for `api/traits.rs`.

//! `traits.rs` exposes `HttpCacheTrait` as a `pub(crate)` type alias for
//! `dyn HttpCache`.  From outside the crate this is not directly accessible,
//! but we can verify its downstream effect: `CacheLayer` must satisfy all bounds
//! required to be stored behind a trait object of that form (`Send + Sync`).
//!
//! These are compile-time proofs — a runtime assertion would add noise without
//! adding information.
